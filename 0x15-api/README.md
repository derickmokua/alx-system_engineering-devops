## What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For

- Complex Applications
- Performance-Critical Tasks
- Handling Binary Data
- Cross-Platform Applications

## What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

## What is a REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) adheres to the principles of REST and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources identified by URLs.

## What are Microservices

Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain.

## What is the CSV Format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, with rows represented by lines and columns separated by commas.

Example:
```csv
name,age,city
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
