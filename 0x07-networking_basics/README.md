Networking basics
Introduction
Welcome to this learning project! The primary goal of this project is to equip you with a solid foundation in networking and communication concepts. You'll delve into topics ranging from the OSI model to IP addressing, data transfer protocols, and network connectivity. The project is designed to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of these essential concepts.

OSI Model
What it is
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols work together. It defines a set of seven layers, each with a specific role in data communication.

How many layers it has
The OSI model consists of seven layers, which are organized in a hierarchical manner.

How it is organized
The OSI model is organized as follows:

Physical
Data Link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application
Network Types
LAN (Local Area Network)
LANs are local networks typically used within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus.
They are commonly used for connecting devices within a small area and enabling resource sharing.
WAN (Wide Area Network)
WANs are expansive networks that cover large geographical areas, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
They facilitate long-distance communication and are used by organizations to connect remote locations.
The Internet
The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks, allowing worldwide communication and data exchange.
It's a vast network built upon the principles of the OSI model, connecting billions of devices worldwide.
IP Address
What is an IP address
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It serves two primary functions: device identification and location addressing.

Types of IP addresses
There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme.

Localhost
Localhost refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1), which is used to establish network connections to the local host (your own device). It's a convenient way to test network applications without affecting external devices.

Subnet
A subnet is a smaller, logical subdivision of an IP network. It helps in optimizing network management and organization by grouping devices based on shared characteristics or location.

Why IPv6 was created
IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. With its significantly larger address space, IPv6 provides a solution to the increasing demand for unique IP addresses as more devices connect to the Internet.

TCP/UDP
Data Transfer Protocols
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two main data transfer protocols used in the OSI model.

Difference between TCP and UDP
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered data delivery. UDP, on the other hand, is connectionless and focuses on speed, making it suitable for applications where real-time data delivery is essential.

Port
A port is a logical endpoint for communication on a device. Ports are used to distinguish different services or processes running on the same device. They are essential for routing data to the correct destination.

SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers
SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443
Network Connectivity
Tool/Protocol for Device Connectivity
One common tool/protocol used to check if a device is connected to a network is "Ping." It sends a test message to the target device and waits for a response, confirming connectivity.
