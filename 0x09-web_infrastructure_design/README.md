# My Project Learning Achievements

## General Objectives

### 1. Diagram Proficiency
   - **Achievement:** I successfully drew a detailed diagram illustrating the web stack I built during the sysadmin/devops track projects.
   - **Description:** The diagram accurately represents the architecture, showcasing the connections and interactions between various components.

### 2. Component Understanding
   - **Achievement:** I effectively explained the functionality of each component within the web stack.
   - **Description:** I demonstrated a deep understanding of the roles and purposes of components, including web servers, databases, load balancers, and other relevant elements.

### 3. System Redundancy Knowledge
   - **Achievement:** I provided a comprehensive explanation of system redundancy and its importance.
   - **Description:** I articulated how redundancy contributes to fault tolerance, ensuring minimal downtime and enhancing overall system reliability.

### 4. Acronym Mastery
   - **Achievement:** I mastered the following acronyms and their meanings:
     - **LAMP:** I understand the components (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) and their collaboration in forming a robust web development environment.
     - **SPOF:** I grasped the concept of Single Point of Failure, identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities to enhance system reliability.
     - **QPS:** I am proficient in understanding Queries Per Second, utilizing it to measure system performance, particularly in the context of databases.

## Additional Notes

- **Independent Explanation:**
  - **Achievement:** I successfully explained the concepts without relying on external resources like Google.
  - **Description:** I demonstrated the ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively and independently.

- **Practical Application:**
  - **Achievement:** I applied acquired knowledge to real-world scenarios, implementing redundancy, optimizing system performance, and troubleshooting issues within a web stack.

## Conclusion

By successfully completing these learning objectives, I have not only finished the project but have also established a solid foundation in sysadmin/devops practices and web stack architecture. Congratulations to myself on these notable accomplishments!
