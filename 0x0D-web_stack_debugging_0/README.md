# README

## Overview

This README provides a brief overview of three key topics essential for modern software engineering and development: Network Basics, Docker, and Web Stack Debugging. These topics are fundamental for setting up, managing, and troubleshooting web applications and services.

## Network Basics

### Introduction
Understanding network basics is crucial for any software developer or system administrator. Networks allow computers to exchange data, share resources, and connect to the internet.

### Key Concepts
- **IP Addressing**: Unique identifiers assigned to each device on a network.
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a network into smaller, more efficient subnetworks.
- **Routing**: Directing data packets between networks.
- **Protocols**: Rules and standards for communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).

### Tools
- **Ping**: Tests connectivity between devices.
- **Traceroute**: Maps the path data takes to reach its destination.
- **Netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

## Docker

### Introduction
Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and run consistently across different environments.

### Key Concepts
- **Container**: A standardized unit of software that packages code and its dependencies.
- **Image**: A read-only template used to create containers.
- **Dockerfile**: A script containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Common Commands
- `docker build`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker run`: Runs a container from an image.
- `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
- `docker stop`: Stops a running container.

## Web Stack Debugging

### Introduction
Web stack debugging involves identifying and fixing issues within the layers of a web application stack. This includes the server, database, application code, and client-side code.

### Key Areas
- **Server-Side Debugging**: Checking server logs, server configurations, and ensuring the server is running correctly.
- **Database Debugging**: Verifying database connections, queries, and data integrity.
- **Application Code Debugging**: Inspecting and fixing issues in the application code (e.g., syntax errors, logic errors).
- **Client-Side Debugging**: Debugging front-end code using browser developer tools.

### Tools
- **Log Files**: Record events and errors for diagnosis.
- **Debuggers**: Tools that allow step-by-step execution of code (e.g., GDB for C/C++, pdb for Python).
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Built-in tools in browsers for inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., Chrome DevTools).

## Conclusion

Mastering these three areas will significantly enhance your ability to develop, deploy, and maintain robust web applications. Whether you're managing networks, using Docker for containerization, or debugging a complex web stack, these skills are invaluable for modern software development.
