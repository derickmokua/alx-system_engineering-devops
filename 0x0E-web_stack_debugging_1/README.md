## Network Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts and components involved in computer networking. Understanding these basics is essential for configuring, managing, and troubleshooting networks.

### Key Concepts

1. **IP Addressing**
   - **IPv4 and IPv6**: Learn about the differences and uses of these IP address types.
   - **Subnetting**: Understand how IP addresses are divided into subnets for efficient network management.

2. **Network Devices**
   - **Routers**: Devices that forward data packets between computer networks.
   - **Switches**: Devices that connect devices within a single network.
   - **Firewalls**: Security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

3. **Protocols**
   - **TCP/IP**: The foundational protocol suite for the internet and other networks.
   - **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for transferring web pages.
   - **FTP/SFTP**: Protocols for transferring files between systems.

4. **Network Layers**
   - **OSI Model**: Understand the 7-layer model (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application).
   - **TCP/IP Model**: A simplified model with 4 layers (Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application).

5. **DNS**
   - **Domain Name System**: Converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

### Tools and Commands

- **ping**: Test the reachability of a host on an IP network.
- **traceroute**: Track the path data takes to a destination.
- **netstat**: Display network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: Display network configuration details for Windows/Linux.

## Web Stack Debugging

This section focuses on identifying and fixing issues within a web application stack, which includes the server, database, and front-end components.

### Key Concepts

1. **Web Servers**
   - **Apache/Nginx**: Popular web servers used to serve web content.
   - **Configuration**: Understanding server configuration files and common directives.

2. **Databases**
   - **SQL/NoSQL**: Different types of databases and how to interact with them.
   - **Common Errors**: Connection issues, query optimization, and data integrity problems.

3. **Front-end**
   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Basic components of web pages and common issues like broken links, styling problems, and script errors.
   - **Browser Developer Tools**: Inspect elements, view console logs, and debug JavaScript.

4. **Back-end**
   - **Application Logic**: Common issues related to server-side code and APIs.
   - **Error Handling**: Logging and tracking errors for debugging.

### Debugging Techniques

- **Log Files**: Check server logs, application logs, and database logs for error messages and warnings.
- **Breakpoints**: Use breakpoints in your code to pause execution and inspect variables.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use tools to monitor performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.

### Tools and Commands

- **curl**: Command-line tool to transfer data from or to a server.
- **telnet**: Used to test network services.
- **top/htop**: Monitor system processes and resource usage.
- **systemctl**: Manage system services on Linux.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Install necessary software (web server, database, development tools).
   - Configure your network settings.

2. **Run Initial Tests**
   - Test basic network connectivity (ping, traceroute).
   - Ensure web server and database are running (systemctl status).

3. **Develop and Debug**
   - Write and deploy your web application.
   - Use the debugging techniques and tools to troubleshoot any issues.

## Conclusion

Mastering network basics and web stack debugging will significantly enhance your ability to develop and maintain robust web applications. Use this guide as a starting point to build your skills and troubleshoot effectively.
