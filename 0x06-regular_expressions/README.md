0x06. Regular expression
Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "regex," are a versatile tool used for pattern matching and text manipulation. They are employed in various programming languages, and in the case of Ruby, the Oniguruma library is the built-in choice for regular expression support.

This project will provide you with an opportunity to create and use regular expressions in the context of Oniguruma. You will be tasked with crafting regex patterns to match specific patterns or extract information from text data.
