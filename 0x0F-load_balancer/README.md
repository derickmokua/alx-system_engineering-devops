## Load Balancer & Web Stack Debugging

### Summary

This project involves setting up a load balancer to distribute network traffic across multiple servers and debugging a web stack to ensure smooth operation of web applications.

### Key Components

1. **Load Balancer Setup**
   - Distributes traffic to improve reliability and scalability.
   
2. **Web Stack Debugging**
   - Identifies and fixes issues within the web stack for optimal performance.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of web servers and networking.
- Access to a server environment for setup and testing.

### Installation

1. Set up your server environment.
2. Install the necessary load balancer software (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).
3. Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic.
4. Debug and troubleshoot any issues in the web stack.

### Usage

- Monitor the load balancer to ensure traffic is evenly distributed.
- Regularly check and debug the web stack to maintain performance.
